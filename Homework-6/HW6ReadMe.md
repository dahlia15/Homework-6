Please find my Weather App in the html file. I was able to link the APIs properly but ran into the following issues:
1) Could not find information on how to clear the results in previous exercises
2) Table to the side is not reactive, but I will keep working to make it work on click
3) Was not able to properly align with card/table that holds the weather information (the grid system is still a bit of a mystery to but I think I'm moving in the right direction)
4) Created a table instead of individual cards to hold 5 day forecast (text is messy as I could not create line breaks but wanted to submit something)
